Blobfrii 3ds client for erista's hShop.
3hs is licensed under GPLv3 (see: LICENSE).
Also included is a copy of the "file_forwarder" project, which is the source
for the applications labelled as "installer" on the hShop website. It is also subject to the GPLv3.
There are 2 official distributions of this code, one is on the hShop website (main source), another
is hosted on github (mirror source), at https://github.com/MyPasswordIsWeak/3hs.


  = = Special thanks to = =

The developers of nlohmann::json (license MIT, see: LICENSE.nlohann-json.TXT), of which their library is bundled,
Ghost, who made me rethink some obfuscation,
everyone in the hShop discord channel, for giving me motivation by insisting a 3ds client is too hard to make,
Coin, for his inspiring lua hShop client,
and Cremè, for making some nice art.

      = = Building = =

Requirements:
 - mbedtls (for nnc, which is bundled)
 - perl (to generate language file)
 - devkitarm
 - libctru
 - citro2d
 - citro3d

Run `make` for a debug build and `make RELEASE=1 cia` for a release cia build.

Other variables used in the building process:
 - VERSION=version-int
 - DEVICE_ID=device-id-int
 - HS_DEBUG_SERVER="debug-server"
 - HS_UPDATE_BASE="update-url"
 - HS_BASE_LOC="api-url"
 - HS_CDN_BASE="cdn-url"
 - HS_SITE_LOC="hsite-url"

To successfully build you need
  HS_UPDATE_BASE && (HS_DEBUG_SERVER || (HS_BASE_LOC && HS_CDN_BASE && HS_SITE_LOC))

You may also need a file called 'hscert.der', which is a DER certificate to be used for https connections
 - If this feature is used you need the runtime dependency xxd too.

Additionally you need a file called source/hsapi_auth.c with the following contents
 #include <string.h>
 const char *hsapi_user = "<api-user>";
 const int hsapi_password_length = <password-length-int>;
 void hsapi_password(char *ret) { memcpy(ret, "<api-password>", hsapi_password_length); }
